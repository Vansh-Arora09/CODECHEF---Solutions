Game of Pooks
We have found a new chess character — pook. It has the qualities of both a rook and a pawn. Specifically, treating the chessboard to be an 
N

N
N×N grid where 
(
i
,

)
(i,j) denotes the intersection of the 
i
i-th row and the

j-th column, a pook placed at square 
(

)
(x,y) threatens the following squares:

Find the maximum number of pooks that can be placed on an empty 
N
×
N
N×N chessboard such that none of them threaten each other.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing a single integer 
N
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the maximum number of pooks that can be placed on the chessboard such that they don't threaten each other.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: There is a single square, so we have a single pook.

Test case 
2
2: We can only place one pook. No matter where the first is placed, placing a second will lead to one of the two being threatened.

Test case

3: Placing 
2
2 pooks on a

×

3×3 grid is easy — for example, place one at 
(
1
,
2
)
(1,2) and another at 
(
3
,
3
)
(3,3). It can be shown that placing three is not possible.
