An array 
B
B of length 
M
M is said to be good if no two elements from different indices sum to 
4
4.
That is, 
B
B is good if for every pair 

(i,j) satisfying 
1
≤
i
<
j
≤
M
1≤i<j≤M, we have
(

You are given an array 
A
A of length 
N
N such that 
1
≤
A
i
≤
3
1≤A 
i
​
 ≤3 for each index 
i
i.

You would like to make 
A
A a good array.
To achieve this, you can repeatedly choose a single element of 
A
A and delete it.
What's the minimum number of deletions needed to make 
A
A a good array?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer 
N
N — the length of the array.
The second line contains 
N
N space-separated integers

  — the elements of the array.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the minimum number of element deletions needed to make 
A
A a good array.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: The array 
A
=
[
1
,
2
,
2
]
A=[1,2,2] is not good, because 
A
2
+
A
3
=
4
A 
2
​
 +A 
3
​
 =4.
One deletion is enough to make it good: for example, we can delete the second element and obtain the array 
A
=
[
1
,
2
]
A=[1,2], which is good.

Test case 
2
2: The array 
A
=
[
1
,
1
]
A=[1,1] is already good, since the only pair of elements it has sums up to 
2
2.

Test case 
3
3: The array 
A
=
[
2
,
3
,
1
]
A=[2,3,1] is not good, because 
A
2
+
A
3
=
4
A 
2
​
 +A 
3
​
 =4.
Deleting either 
A
2
A 
2
​
  or 
A
3
A 
3
​
  will make it good, so one deletion is enough.

Test case 
4
4: The array 
A
=
[
2
,
3
,
1
,
3
,
2
]
A=[2,3,1,3,2] is not good.
Two deletions are required to make it good: for example, the third element and last element can be deleted to make the array 
[
2
,
3
,
3
]
[2,3,3], which is good.
It can be proved that 
A
A cannot become good after a single deletion.
